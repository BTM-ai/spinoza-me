- âœ… **PDF Extraction**: Text extraction from PDF files using pdfminer.six
- âœ… **Data Models**: Classes for representing different elements in Spinoza's Ethics
- âœ… **Neo4J Integration**: Connection to Neo4J database and graph creation
- âœ… **LangChain Integration**: Basic integration with LangChain for RAG capabilities
- âœ… **Command Interface**: Simple command-line interface for interacting with the application

### Documentation

- âœ… **README.md**: Comprehensive project documentation with installation and usage instructions
- âœ… **Memory Bank**: Detailed documentation of project context, architecture, and progress
- âœ… **.env.example**: Example environment variables file with configuration templates

## What's Left to Build

### Data Ingestion

- ðŸ”² **Enhanced Parsing**: Improve text parsing logic for the specific format of the French translation
- ðŸ”² **Reference Detection**: Enhance reference detection to capture more complex references
- ðŸ”² **Multi-Language Support**: Extend the parsing logic to handle multiple translations
- ðŸ”² **Validation**: Add validation of the extracted data and created graph

### Frontend

- ðŸ”² **Next.js Setup**: Set up the Next.js project with Tailwind CSS
- ðŸ”² **Supabase Integration**: Integrate Supabase for authentication and data storage
- ðŸ”² **Chat Interface**: Create the conversational interface for interacting with Spinoza's Ethics
- ðŸ”² **Responsive Design**: Ensure the interface works well on different devices

### Deployment

- ðŸ”² **Neo4J Deployment**: Deploy the Neo4J database to a cloud provider or self-hosted server
- ðŸ”² **Backend Deployment**: Deploy the Python backend as a serverless function or traditional server
- ðŸ”² **Frontend Deployment**: Deploy the Next.js frontend to Vercel
- ðŸ”² **CI/CD Pipeline**: Set up continuous integration and deployment

## Current Status

The project is in the early stages of development, with a focus on the data ingestion pipeline. The core infrastructure for extracting text from PDFs and creating a Neo4J graph database is in place, but it needs to be tested with real data and enhanced to handle the specific format of the French translation.

The next phase will involve developing the frontend with Next.js, Tailwind CSS, and Supabase, and creating the conversational interface for interacting with Spinoza's Ethics.

## Known Issues

- **Parsing Logic**: The current parsing logic is simplified and may not handle all the complexities of the actual text
- **Reference Detection**: The reference detection is basic and may miss some references
- **Sample Data**: The current implementation uses sample data rather than actual extracted text
- **Error Handling**: Error handling could be improved to provide more informative error messages

## Evolution of Project Decisions

### Initial Approach

The initial approach was to use a simple text extraction and parsing approach, with a focus on getting a basic implementation working. The graph structure was designed to represent the key elements in Spinoza's Ethics (parts, definitions, propositions, etc.) and the relationships between them.

### Current Direction

The current direction is to enhance the parsing logic to better handle the specific format of the French translation, and to improve the reference detection to capture more complex references. The graph structure remains the same, but we're considering optimizations for query performance and contextual understanding.

### Future Considerations

For the future, we're considering:

- **Multi-Language Support**: Extending the parsing logic to handle multiple translations
- **Enhanced Graph Structure**: Optimizing the graph structure for better query performance and contextual understanding
- **Advanced RAG Techniques**: Exploring more advanced RAG techniques for better context retrieval and response generation
- **User Feedback Integration**: Incorporating user feedback to improve the conversational interface
