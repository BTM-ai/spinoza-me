# Product Context

## Purpose

Spinoza-Me is designed to make Spinoza's philosophical work "Ethics" more accessible and interactive through a conversational interface. The application allows users to engage with Spinoza's ideas through natural language conversation, making complex philosophical concepts more approachable.

## Problems Solved

1. **Accessibility**: Spinoza's Ethics is a dense, complex philosophical text that can be challenging for many readers to approach and understand.

2. **Engagement**: Traditional reading of philosophical texts can be passive and one-directional. Spinoza-Me creates an interactive, two-way engagement with the material.

3. **Contextual Understanding**: The Ethics contains many interconnected ideas and references. The Graph RAG approach helps maintain these connections and provide contextual understanding.

4. **Language Barriers**: By supporting multiple translations, the application can make Spinoza's work accessible to speakers of different languages.

## User Experience

### Target Users

- Students studying philosophy
- Academics and researchers in philosophy
- General readers interested in Spinoza's work
- People who prefer conversational learning over traditional reading

### User Journey

1. **Discovery**: Users discover the application through academic recommendations, philosophy forums, or search engines.

2. **Onboarding**: Users are introduced to the application's capabilities and how to effectively interact with the Spinoza chatbot.

3. **Interaction**: Users engage in conversations with the Spinoza chatbot, asking questions about Ethics, requesting explanations of concepts, or exploring connections between ideas.

### User Needs
